         The Environment is the place of human existence and activities and the supply base of natural resources for human production and consumption. At present, human beings are faced with increasingly serious environmental problems because no country or region can avoid the continuous environmental pollution and the destruction of natural resources, which directly threatens the ecological environment, the health of human beings and the survival of generations. On this website, we will talk about some funny knowledge about protecting our environment.

         <big><strong><ins>Air pollution:<br></ins></strong></big>
         Air pollution is caused by solid and liquid particles suspended in the air, as well as certain gases. These particles and gases can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust and wildfires.<br></p>
         <P>Air pollutants have a complex relationship with climate change. Some pollutants, such as black carbon and ozone, contribute to warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere, while some of the others form light-reflecting particles that cool the climate.</P>
         <p><big><strong><ins>Six serious effects of air pollution on the environment:</ins></strong></big>
         <li>Global Warming.</li><br>
         <li>Climate Change.</li><br>
         <li>Acid Rain.</li> <br>
         <li>Smog effect.</li><br>
         <li>Extinction of animal species.</li><br>
             <li>Respiratory health problems.</li><br></p>
         <p><big><strong><ins>Global Warming:</ins></strong></big><br>
             When people burn fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, or cut down forests and burn them, a large amount of carbon dioxide, namely greenhouse gas, will be produced. As a result, the energy absorbed and emitted by the ground gas system will be unbalanced, and the energy will accumulate continuously in the ground gas system, resulting in the rise of temperature and global warming. Global warming is a serious threat to human existence and is one of the major current environmental problems.</p>
             <p> <big><strong><ins>Land pollution:</ins></strong></big><br>
             Land due to mining or industrial waste or agricultural chemical substances invasion, the deterioration of the original physical and chemical properties of the soil, the decrease of land production potential, the deterioration of product quality and human and animal and plant harm to the phenomenon and process.</p>
         <p>According to different sources of pollution, it can be divided into four categories: industrial pollution, transportation pollution, agricultural pollution and domestic pollution. Industrial pollution is mainly caused by industrial emissions of waste residue, wastewater, waste gas pollution of the atmosphere, water and soil and other environmental pollution. <br>

        Recycling is the process of turning old materials into new materials and items. It can help reduce pollution by saving on the cost of making new materials and reducing the number of pollutants that factories release into the air. Recycling is about more than just reducing air and water pollution. It also helps slow the greenhouse gases that cause global warming and helps protect the planet's resources. Recycling keeps waste out of landfills.<br>
         <br> <big><strong><ins>Four Benefits of Recycling:</ins></strong></big> 
          <li>Reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators.</li><br>
         <li>Protect natural resources, such as wood, water and minerals.</li><br>
         <li>Reduce the need to collect new materials and prevent contamination, such as plastics.</li> <br>
         <li>To save energy.</li><br>

         <big><strong><ins>Story of climate change -- Raging Wildfires <br></ins></strong></big>
        This year, record-breaking fires have swept through dry areas of Australia, the lush Amazon rainforest and large swaths of the western United States. In Australia, fires earlier this year affected hundreds of millions of wild animals and sent smoke 20 miles into the atmosphere. In California, a relentless wildfire has scorched more than 4 million acres, nearly double the state's previous record for the largest wildfire in a single season. The August Complex fire alone has burned more than a million acres, making it by far the largest wildfire in California history. Millions of people across the West are feeling the effects of the fires as smoke spreads and the air becomes unbreathable. The Amazon rainforest has also experienced terrible fire damage, including old-growth forests.<br>
        <br> Rising temperatures can lead to devastating fire seasons because they increase the chances of major heat waves that dry up fuel. This creates bigger and more intense fires. Warmer weather will also exacerbate droughts. A study presented in March found that the likelihood of extreme fires like this year's in Australia has increased by 30 per cent because of climate change. These massive fires also release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, making warming worse -- so actual fires only add fuel to the already known warming.<br>
         <br><big><strong><ins>Story of plastic pollution -- Whales and the plastics problem<br></ins></strong></big><br>
         Whale conservation is essential to the health of our oceans for all of us. They nourish Marine ecosystems and even help us cope with the climate crisis. Whale health is related to and a key indicator of ocean health. They even help boost a global whale-watching tourism industry worth more than $2 billion. However, even these ocean giants are under the influence of "the ocean's deadliest predator" : plastic pollution. Plastic waste pollutes every corner of the ocean, threatens Marine wildlife and even ends up in the seafood we eat. From our local beaches to remote tropical islands and polar regions, plastic is killing our oceans and wildlife. This is the clearest example of man's impact on the ocean. Currently, more than 11 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean each year. By 2050, there could be more plastic in the oceans by weight than fish. <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/whales-and-the-plastics problem"title="Whales and the plastics problem">Read more here.</a><br>

         <big><strong><ins>Introduce:<br></ins></strong></big>
         Environmental policy: any measure taken by a government or corporation or other public or private organization concerning the impact of human activities on the environment. The environment, in particular those measures designed to prevent or reduce the harmful effects of human activities on ecosystems.<br>
 <br>Environmental policies can include laws and policies dealing with water and air pollution, chemical and oil spills, smog, drinking water quality, land protection and management, and wildlife protection (for example, protection of endangered species).<br>
