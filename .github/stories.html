         <big><strong><ins>Story of climate change -- Raging Wildfires <br></ins></strong></big>
        This year, record-breaking fires have swept through dry areas of Australia, the lush Amazon rainforest and large swaths of the western United States. In Australia, fires earlier this year affected hundreds of millions of wild animals and sent smoke 20 miles into the atmosphere. In California, a relentless wildfire has scorched more than 4 million acres, nearly double the state's previous record for the largest wildfire in a single season. The August Complex fire alone has burned more than a million acres, making it by far the largest wildfire in California history. Millions of people across the West are feeling the effects of the fires as smoke spreads and the air becomes unbreathable. The Amazon rainforest has also experienced terrible fire damage, including old-growth forests.<br>
        <br> Rising temperatures can lead to devastating fire seasons because they increase the chances of major heat waves that dry up fuel. This creates bigger and more intense fires. Warmer weather will also exacerbate droughts. A study presented in March found that the likelihood of extreme fires like this year's in Australia has increased by 30 per cent because of climate change. These massive fires also release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, making warming worse -- so actual fires only add fuel to the already known warming.<br>
         <br><big><strong><ins>Story of plastic pollution -- Whales and the plastics problem<br></ins></strong></big>
         Whale conservation is essential to the health of our oceans for all of us. They nourish Marine ecosystems and even help us cope with the climate crisis. Whale health is related to and a key indicator of ocean health. They even help boost a global whale-watching tourism industry worth more than $2 billion. However, even these ocean giants are under the influence of "the ocean's deadliest predator" : plastic pollution. Plastic waste pollutes every corner of the ocean, threatens Marine wildlife and even ends up in the seafood we eat. From our local beaches to remote tropical islands and polar regions, plastic is killing our oceans and wildlife. This is the clearest example of man's impact on the ocean. Currently, more than 11 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean each year. By 2050, there could be more plastic in the oceans by weight than fish. <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/whales-and-the-plastics-problem"title="Whales and the plastics problem">Read more here.</a><br>
